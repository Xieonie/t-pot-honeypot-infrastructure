DISCLAIMER:

This project is designed for educational and research purposes only. The 
software creates intentionally vulnerable systems (honeypots) that are 
designed to attract and log malicious activities.

IMPORTANT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

1. LEGAL COMPLIANCE: Users are solely responsible for ensuring that the 
   deployment and operation of honeypot systems complies with all applicable 
   local, national, and international laws and regulations.

2. NETWORK ISOLATION: The honeypot systems created by this software MUST be 
   properly isolated from production networks and systems. Failure to maintain 
   proper isolation may result in security breaches.

3. MONITORING REQUIREMENT: Honeypot systems require continuous monitoring. 
   Unmonitored honeypots may be used by attackers as launching points for 
   further attacks.

4. DATA PROTECTION: Logs and data collected by honeypot systems may contain 
   sensitive information. Users must ensure proper data protection and privacy 
   measures are in place.

5. INCIDENT RESPONSE: Users must have appropriate incident response procedures 
   in place to handle potential security incidents involving honeypot systems.

6. NO WARRANTY: This software is provided without any warranty. Users assume 
   all risks associated with its deployment and operation.

By using this software, you acknowledge that you understand these risks and 
agree to use the software responsibly and in compliance with all applicable 
laws and best practices.
